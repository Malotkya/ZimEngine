# Zim Engine

## Goals
The main goal of this project is to have an easy way to create simple web apps that can load new pages without realoading the browser
and have most of if not all of the rendering happening on the server side. 

I am attempting to use as little external librarys as possible to prevent package clutter from building up.

## To Do
1) ~~Static Folder Implementation.~~ Static folder that Supports audio/video streaming
2) Be able to incororporate other view engines.
3) ~~Easy Authentication~~
4) Mulipart/Form Data handling
5) ~~POST body data handling~~
6) ~~Deep or Recursive Route(r)s that work.~~
